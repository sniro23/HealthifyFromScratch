# Healthify Digital Health Platform - Project Scratchpad

## Current Active Implementation Plans

### Primary Implementation
- **Task:** Healthify Digital Health Platform Implementation
- **Implementation Plan:** `docs/implementation-plan/healthify-digital-health-platform-implementation.md`
- **Status:** Planning Phase - Ready for Executor
- **Branch Name:** `healthify-main-implementation`
- **Priority:** High
- **Last Updated:** [Current Date]

## Project Overview

This scratchpad tracks the development of the Healthify digital health platform, a comprehensive telemedicine solution with FHIR R4 compliance, microservices architecture, and Supabase integration for the Sri Lankan healthcare market.

**Key Deliverables:**
- Three user portals (Patient, Provider, Admin) 
- Nine FHIR-compliant microservices
- Real-time communication system
- HIPAA-compliant security and audit logging

## Current Focus Areas

### Immediate Next Steps
1. Review and approve the detailed implementation plan
2. Setup development environment and infrastructure
3. Begin Phase 1: Infrastructure Foundation

### Pending Decisions
- Final confirmation of backend-first vs UI-first approach
- FHIR server selection (managed vs open-source)
- Deployment environment selection (AWS vs Azure vs hybrid)

## Lessons Learned

*This section will be updated during implementation to capture insights and avoid repeated mistakes.*

### Development Process
- [Date] - Lesson learned content will be added here during execution

### Technical Insights  
- [Date] - Technical lessons will be documented here

### Integration Challenges
- [Date] - Integration lessons will be captured here

## Risk Tracking

### High Priority Risks
1. **FHIR Compliance Complexity** - Status: Identified, mitigation planned
2. **HIPAA Compliance Requirements** - Status: Addressed in implementation plan
3. **Real-time Communication Stability** - Status: Architecture designed with fallbacks
4. **Microservices Integration** - Status: API Gateway strategy defined

### Medium Priority Risks
1. **Supabase Integration Challenges** - Status: Early POC recommended
2. **Performance at Scale** - Status: Load testing planned in Phase 5
3. **Payment Gateway Integration** - Status: Sandbox testing approach defined

## Communication Log

### Planner â†’ Human User
- [Date] Created comprehensive implementation plan based on PSD.Md
- [Date] Recommended backend-first approach for healthcare compliance
- [Date] Broke down project into 5 phases with detailed tasks

### Outstanding Questions for Human User
- Confirmation of development approach preference
- Timeline constraints or deadline requirements
- Resource allocation (team size, availability)
- Priority ordering of user portals (Patient vs Provider vs Admin)

## Next Actions Required

### For Human User Review
1. Review detailed implementation plan
2. Approve backend-first development approach
3. Confirm resource availability and timeline
4. Give permission to proceed to execution phase

### For Executor (Pending Approval)
1. Create feature branch `healthify-main-implementation`
2. Setup development environment
3. Initialize Supabase project and database
4. Begin Phase 1 implementation tasks
