### 2025-06-30: üö® CRITICAL BUILD FAILURE ANALYSIS & SYSTEMATIC RESOLUTION PLAN

**‚ö†Ô∏è PLANNER MODE: EMERGENCY SITUATION ASSESSMENT**

**Crisis Summary:**
- **Patient Portal**: Complete PostCSS failure - `Cannot find module '@tailwindcss/postcss'`
- **Admin Portal**: Next.js TypeScript config rejection - Cannot start development server
- **Provider Portal**: Needs verification after Next.js downgrade
- **Workspace Commands**: npm workspace detection failures

**Root Cause Identified:**
1. **Tailwind CSS v4 Breaking Changes**: PostCSS plugin architecture completely redesigned
2. **Next.js Configuration Strictness**: Version 14.2.13 requires JavaScript configs, not TypeScript
3. **Dependency Chain Fragility**: Modern frontend ecosystem has cascading failure modes
4. **Directory Structure Sensitivity**: npm workspaces require exact location matching

**üéØ SYSTEMATIC RESOLUTION STRATEGY DEVELOPED:**

**Phase 1 - Emergency Stabilization:**
- Downgrade Tailwind CSS v4 ‚Üí v3.4.4 across all portals
- Convert all `next.config.ts` ‚Üí `next.config.js` files
- Standardize React 18.2.0 and Next.js 14.2.13 versions
- Fix PostCSS configurations to use stable plugin versions

**Phase 2 - Workspace Standardization:**
- Verify frontend directory structure for workspace detection
- Test unified development commands (`npm run dev:frontend`)
- Validate individual portal build commands

**Phase 3 - Configuration Harmonization:**
- Align ESLint, TypeScript, and dependency versions
- Test shared component library integration
- Verify browser accessibility for all portals

**üö® CRITICAL SUCCESS CRITERIA:**
- ‚úÖ Patient Portal: Builds and runs on port 3100
- ‚úÖ Provider Portal: Builds and runs on port 3200  
- ‚úÖ Admin Portal: Builds and runs on port 3300
- ‚úÖ Unified Commands: `npm run dev:frontend` works correctly
- ‚úÖ Browser Access: All portals accessible from browser

**‚è±Ô∏è RESOLUTION TIMELINE:**
