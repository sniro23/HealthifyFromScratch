## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL SITUATION ANALYSIS - BUILD FAILURE CASCADE

### üö® Current Status: SYSTEMATIC BUILD FAILURE ACROSS ALL PORTALS

**Build Failure Analysis:**
- **Patient Portal**: `Cannot find module '@tailwindcss/postcss'` - Tailwind CSS v4 PostCSS integration failure
- **Provider Portal**: Next.js 14.2.13 requires JavaScript config files, not TypeScript
- **Admin Portal**: Same Next.js TypeScript config error
- **Workspace Configuration**: npm workspaces not detecting frontend/* properly

**Root Cause Assessment:**
1. **Tailwind CSS v4 Breaking Changes**: New PostCSS plugin architecture incompatible with existing configuration
2. **Next.js Version Conflicts**: 14.2.13 has stricter configuration requirements than 15.x
3. **Directory Structure Issues**: Portals were initially in wrong workspace locations
4. **Dependency Version Mismatches**: React 18 vs 19, Tailwind v4 vs v3, ESLint 8 vs 9

**Last Updated:** 2025-06-30

## üéØ PLANNER: SYSTEMATIC BUILD RESOLUTION STRATEGY

### **CRITICAL ISSUE BREAKDOWN:**

#### **Issue 1: Tailwind CSS v4 PostCSS Integration Failure**
**Error:** `Cannot find module '@tailwindcss/postcss'`
**Root Cause:** Tailwind CSS v4 has breaking changes in PostCSS plugin architecture
**Impact:** Patient portal completely non-functional

#### **Issue 2: Next.js Configuration Format Conflicts**
**Error:** `Configuring Next.js via 'next.config.ts' is not supported`
**Root Cause:** Next.js 14.2.13 stricter than 15.x about TypeScript config files
