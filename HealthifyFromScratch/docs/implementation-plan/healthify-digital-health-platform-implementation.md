# Healthify Digital Health Platform Implementation

## Branch Name
`healthify-main-implementation`

## Background and Motivation

Based on the Project Specification Document (PSD.Md), Healthify addresses critical deficiencies in Sri Lanka's healthcare infrastructure including fragmented systems, long waiting times, high consultation fees, and limited preventive care focus. 

The platform will provide accessible, integrated, and continuous telemedicine services built on FHIR R4 standards for maximum interoperability. The strategic adoption of FHIR-native data modeling and Supabase integration will enable rapid deployment while ensuring compliance with healthcare regulations like HIPAA.

**Core Problem Statement:** Sri Lanka's healthcare system suffers from fragmented care delivery, limited accessibility, and lack of preventive focus. Healthify will bridge these gaps through a comprehensive digital health platform.

**Strategic Goals:**
- Deliver comprehensive telemedicine services (video, chat, home visits)
- Ensure FHIR R4 compliance for maximum interoperability
- Implement HIPAA-compliant security and audit logging
- Support subscription-based care models including "Ever Care" program
- Enable seamless integration with external healthcare systems

- Comprehensive security headers and CORS policies

### FHIR Implementation Strategy

**Hybrid Data Persistence Model:**
- Clinical data stored as JSONB objects in PostgreSQL for full FHIR resource structure
- Traditional relational tables for non-FHIR administrative data
- AWS S3 for binary files with FHIR DocumentReference metadata
- Redis caching for frequently accessed non-persistent data

**FHIR Resource Mapping:**
- Patient, Practitioner, PractitionerRole resources for identity management
- Appointment, Schedule, Slot, ServiceRequest for scheduling
- MedicationRequest for prescription management
- Communication for secure messaging
- ChargeItem, Invoice for billing and payments
- CarePlan, Observation, Questionnaire for Ever Care program
- AuditEvent, Provenance for comprehensive audit logging

### API Design Principles

**FHIR RESTful APIs:**
- Standard CRUD operations on all FHIR resources
- FHIR search parameters for efficient querying
- Request/response validation against FHIR profiles
- API versioning strategy for future FHIR updates
- Circuit breaker patterns for service resilience

**Security and Performance:**
- OAuth 2.0/JWT authentication with SMART-on-FHIR compliance
- Rate limiting with tier-based restrictions (guests: 100 req/hour, subscribers: 1000 req/hour)
- API response optimization with <500ms target for critical operations
- Load balancing and health checks for all services
