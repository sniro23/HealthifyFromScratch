# Healthify Digital Health Platform - Project Implementation Plan

## Executive Summary

This project plan implements the Healthify digital health platform as specified in the Project Specification Document (PSD.Md). The platform will deliver a comprehensive telemedicine solution with FHIR R4 compliance, microservices architecture, and Supabase integration for the Sri Lankan healthcare market.

**Key Deliverables:**

- Three user portals (Patient, Provider, Admin) built with React Native/React.js
- Nine FHIR-compliant microservices
- Hybrid PostgreSQL database with JSONB for FHIR resources
- Real-time communication capabilities
- HIPAA-compliant security and audit logging

**Branch Name:** `healthify-main-implementation`

## Background and Motivation

Based on the PSD.Md specification, Healthify addresses critical deficiencies in Sri Lanka's healthcare infrastructure including fragmented systems, long waiting times, high consultation fees, and limited preventive care focus. The platform will provide accessible, integrated, and continuous telemedicine services built on FHIR standards for maximum interoperability.
